# Big Data Project 2
_WPI Graduate Course: DS503 - Big Data Management_

In this project, I wrote java map-reduce jobs that implement advanced operations in Hadoop.

I implemented three advanced operations in this project: 

1. Spatial Join
2. Distance-Based Outlier Detection Clustering
3. K-Means Clustering

For more details on the project implementation, please see the _Readme.pdf_
